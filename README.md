ABOUT THE PROJECT

•	THIS PROJECT IS ABOUT THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF COVID-19. I HAVE MADE A LINE AND A BAR GRAPH TO THE IMPACT. 

•	THE PYTHON PROJECT WHICH I HAVE MADE HAS THE CAPABILITY OF A AI ASSITANT DEEPA WHICH WILL BE HELPING YOU WHEN YOU GO THOUGH THE PROJECT.

•	THE NO CORONA VIRUS LEGEND SHOWS THE CONTRIBUTION OF EACH COUNTRY IN PERCENTAGES(%) WHEN THERE IS NO CORONA VIRUS.

•	THE BASE LINE SCENARIO SHOWS THE AVERAGE ECONOMY OF EACH COUNTRY IN PERCENTAGES(%) WITH AND WITHOUT CORONA VIRUS.

•	THE RISK SCENARIO (PANDEMIC) SHOWS THE AVERAGE ECONOMY OF EACH COUNTRY IN PERCENTAGES(%) WITH CORONA VIRUS.

•	THE HIGEST ECONOMY HAVING COUNTRY,THE LOWEST ECONIMY HAVING COUNTRY,THE ECONOMIC OF EACH COUNTRY CAN BE SEEN IN DATA ANALYSIS. THE GLOBAL IN THE GRAPH SHOWS THE OVERALL ECONOMIC IMPACT OF COVID-19 OF ALL OVER THE WORLD.

•	BY TYPING 1 YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO SEE WHOLE DATA SET. 
•	BY TYPING 2 YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO SEE THE GRAPHS.
•	BY TYPING 3 YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO SEE DATA ANALYSIS. 
•	BY TYPING 4 YOU WOULD EXIT THE DOCUMENT AND THNKING SLIDE APPEARS.
